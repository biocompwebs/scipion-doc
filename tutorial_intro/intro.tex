\subsection*{Intended audience}

This tutorial provides a general introduction to Scipion, an image
processing framework to obtain 3D models of macromolecular complexes
using Electron Microscopy (EM). It is designed to introduce 3D image
processing in EM to people without any prior knowledge of Scipion,
some limited knowledge about 3D-EM image processing, and basic
computer skills.

\subsection*{We'd like to hear from you}

\section{Software Installation}

The first step is to download %before starting to work on your projects is to download
and install \scipion and related software packages. We describe
briefly the process in the next sections. For the full documentation please refer to
\url{http://scipionwiki.cnb.csic.es/bin/view/TWiki/NewInstallation}.

\subsection{Xmipp}

Xmipp is one of the main EM software packages supported in \scipion. Since  automatic
installation is not supported yet to download
%One of the main components of \scipion is the Xmipp package. To get
the latest version please use:

\begin{command}
git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/newxmipp/code xmipp
\end{command}

\noindent
then change to the \directory{xmipp} directory and run the installation with

\begin{command}
./install.sh
\end{command}

%\subsection{Scipion and Extra Packages}
\subsection{Scipion with all Packages}

To get the latest version of \scipion run

\begin{command}
git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/pyworkflow/code scipion
\end{command}

\noindent
Then change to the \directory{scipion} directory. Finally run:

\begin{command}
./scipion install --with-all-packages --with-xmipp=\$XMIPP\_HOME
\end{command}

\noindent
We use \comm{with-all-packages} to install the majority of the packages supported, eg:
Relion, Eman, Brandeis, Spider, etc; To specify the Xmipp installation folder we 
configure \verb+$XMIPP_HOME+.


\section{Reconstruction of a Viral Capsid}

In this demo, we use the \emph{single particle analysis} approach to obtain
a 3D reconstruction of a \emph{Bovine Papillomavirus}. The EM images have been kindly
provided by \href{http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/}{Dr.~Grigorieff’s Lab}. Micrographs were
collected at 300 $kV$ and a calibrated magnification of 56,588,
giving a pixel
size of 1.237 \AA  \citep{Wolf2010}. 

\subsection{Getting Started}

To download the data required for this tutorial use the following command:

\begin{command}
scipion testdata --download xmipp\_tutorial
\end{command}

\noindent
It will be downloaded to \$\directory{SCIPION\_HOME/data/tests}. 

To start image processing in \scipion we need to run \comm{scipion} from the command line.
For this tutorial we register a new project by clicking the \keys{Create Project}
button and specifying project name. Then we navigate to project window (Figure \ref{fig:Project}).  
Left panel displays active workflow (Protocols SPA) 
and its different reconstruction tasks listing protocols available.
Top right panel displays the sequence of protocols executed by the user and its state: running, finished, aborted. Users can visualize it using list or tree views.
Finally bottom right panel displays information for the selected run, such as inputs and outputs, execution logs or documentation - also provides "Analyze Results" button to visualize outputs.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Project window}
\label{fig:Project}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Import Micrographs}

The first step is to import the micrographs to your scipion
project. To do this, double-click the \keys{Import Micrographs}
button. Micrographs are available at:

\verb+$SCIPION_HOME/data/tests/xmipp_tutorial/micrographs/*.mrc+

\noindent Acquisition info is displayed  in Figure \ref{fig:ImportMics}.  
Modify input and click on execute to run protocol. The project window will present the new information as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:ProjectGUI}. If we press the \keys{Analyze Results} button imported micrographs will be loaded.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]
{{images/01.Import_Mics}.png}
\caption{Import Micrographs Protocol.}
\label{fig:ImportMics}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{{images/02.Project_GUI}.png}
\caption{Project window after processing Import Micrographs protocol.}
\label{fig:ProjectGUI}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Downsample Micrographs}

After importing the micrographs we can
perform the next step: \textbf{Preprocess Micrographs}. This protocol
combines multiple Xmipp programs in order to perform different operations
over the micrographs (Figure \ref{fig:Preprocess}). We want to downsample micrographs with
a downsample factor of 5. To fill the \textit{Input micrographs} field, simply click on the
magnifying glass button and select the output from the previous step.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/03.Downsampling_Mics}.png}
\caption{Preprocess Micrographs Protocol.}
\label{fig:Preprocess}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CTF Estimation}

The next step is to estimate the CTFs (Contrast Transfer Functions) of
the micrographs either using \textit{CTFFind} \citep{Mindell2003} or
\textit{Xmipp CTF estimation}. These protocols estimate the PSD (Power Spectral Density) of the
micrographs to then estimate the parameters of the CTF (defocus U,
defocus V, defocus angle, etc).  They cut the micrographs into plenty
of images with the desired window size. After that, they compute the Fourier
Transform of each image and make an average.




To estimate the CTF you will need some parameters
describing the frequency region to be analyzed. The parameters shown
in Figure \ref{fig:CTFFind} are the proper ones for this example.
The limiting frequencies must be such that all zeros of the PSD are
contained within those frequencies. There is a wizard, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:CTFwizard}, that helps in choosing those frequencies. To
see the full available options, choose the \verb+Expert Level+ in the
dropdown menu.  Please note that the range of defocus search is
usually larger than the one used in this example, and it must be
chosen according to your data set.





\begin{figure}
\minipage{0.47\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{{images/04.CTFFind}.png}
  \caption{CTFFind protocol.}
  \label{fig:CTFFind}
\endminipage\hfill
\minipage{0.51\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{{images/16.CTFWizard}.png}
  \caption{Wizard to choose the frequencies.}
  \label{fig:CTFwizard}
\endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}

The CTFs of good micrographs typically have multiple concentric rings, shown
in Figure \ref{fig:CTFs} left, extending from the image center towards its edges.
Bad micrographs may lack rings or have very few rings that hardly extend from
the image center. A reason to discard micrographs may be the presence of
strongly asymmetric rings (astigmatism, Figure \ref{fig:CTFs} center) or rings
that fade in a particular direction (drift, Figure \ref{fig:CTFs} right).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/images-016.jpg}
\caption{CTFs of good, astigmatic and drift micrographs respectively.}
\label{fig:CTFs}
\end{figure}

When the protocol (either CTFFind or Xmipp CTF estimation) is finished
you may click on the \keys{Analyze Results} button (Figure
\ref{fig:CTFResult}). To discard micrographs with bad CTFs you may
click with the mouse right button and press \textbf{Disable}. Once you
finish the selection, press on the \keys{Micrographs} button to
create your subset of micrographs with only the enabled ones.

Sometimes the CTF estimation algorithm may fail to find the rings even
if they can be seen by eye. If this is the case, you may help the
algorithm to find the rings by clicking on the image with the mouse
right-button and choosing \textbf{Recalculate CTF} on the menu that
appears. A graphical interface will help you to correctly identify the
CTF. You must provide the first CTF zero and the search range, and then
press \verb+OK+. When you finish, press the \keys{Recalculate CTFs}
button.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/17.CTFREsults}.png}
\caption{Output visualization of the CTFFind protocol that shows the
CTFs of all the micrographs, and different related parameters.}
\label{fig:CTFResult}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Particle Picking}

Now you are ready to pick particles from micrographs. You can pick particles with either \textit{Xmipp supervised picking},
\textit{Eman boxer} or \textit{Bsoft particle picking} . We illustrate here
particle picking with Eman and Xmipp using as particle size 110.

\begin{description}

\item[EMAN boxer] \hfill \\

Eman boxer has manual picking and several modes of
automatic picking, with fast outcome. Please refer to its
\href{http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2}{webpage} for futher
information. When you are done picking particles you are asked if you want to register output.  If you choose
\keys{Yes}, output coordinates are generated.



\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/05.EmanPicking}.png}
\caption{EMAN boxer, an interface for particle picking.}
\label{fig:EmanPP}
\end{figure}

\item[Xmipp particle picking] \hfill \\


Xmipp supervised picking has manual and automatic picking. Automatic picking is activated using autopick.
Particles added or removed manually after autopick are used to correct classifier. 
When you are done picking particles you can click on \keys{Add Coordinates} to register output.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/05.XmippPicking}.png}
\caption{Xmipp supervised picking, a different interface for particle picking.}
\label{fig:XmippPickingParticles}
\end{figure}



\begin{itemize}
\item Use \keys{\shift + mouse wheel} in the overview window to zoom
  in and out.
\item Mark particles with the \keys{mouse left} button. You may move
  its position by clicking the left mouse button on the selected
  particle and dragging it to the new position.
\item Use \keys{\shift + left mouse} over a selected particle in order
  to remove it.
\item You can apply filters to the micrographs, so that you may see
  the particles better. Select in the
  menu \menu{Filters} as many filters
  as you like.


\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\subsection{Extract Particles}

Click on \menu{Particles > Extract > xmipp3 - extract particles}.
This will launch our next protocol that will allow you
to extract, normalize and correct the CTF phase of your picked
particles, among other things. Modify the default parameters according
to the ones shown in Figures \ref{fig:XmippPP}, 
\ref{fig:ExtractParams}. They will contain:

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/06.Extract_Particles2}.png}
  \caption{Extract particles protocol (tab \texttt{Input})}
  \label{fig:XmippPP}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/06.Extract_ParticlesB}.png}
  \caption{Extract particles protocol (tab \texttt{Preprocess})}
  \label{fig:ExtractParams}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{coordinates} of the particles in the micrographs,
  which are taken from the results of the previous step. Also in the
  same tab, the \textit{particle box size} in pixels (in this case 110
  px).
\item The \textit{invert contrast} flag. If activated, bright
  regions become dark regions and the other way around. This flag
  should be set so that the extracted particles are white over a dark
  background.
\item The \textit{phase flipping} flag. If activated,
  the protocol corrects the CTF phase of your particles. We need to activate this flag 
  since we plan to use projection matching to reconstruct volume.
\item The \textit{normalize} flag. If activated (recommended), the
  particles are normalized to have zero mean and a standard deviation
  of one for the background pixels.
\end{itemize}


% TODO: see the definition of zscore and explain this a bit more.

The protocol also can sort the particles based on general statistics
assigning to each particle a z-score value. Particles with low z-score
are reliable and the ones with large z-score are outliers. Press the
\keys{Analyze Results} button in the main window to check the
extracted and normalized images.

\subsubsection{Particles Selection}

By default, particles displayed are sorted by
z-score. If you want to remove some particles, eg: because they are outliers, you can use 
\menu{right click > disable }
To create a new set of particles you can click on \keys{Add Particles} button 
(\ref{fig:SubsetSelection})).

\end{figure}

\subsection{3D Reconstruction: Projection Matching}

Having the right angles of each projection is crucial for making a 3D
reconstruction.  However, in 3DEM you don’t know a priori the angles
and you have to estimate them as part of the problem. The most popular
way of estimating them is by comparing somehow the projections of a
volume that is similar to the volume to be reconstructed (initial
model) with the images obtained from the microscope.

A possible approach is to generate equidistant projections from the
initial model. The experimental dataset is then compared (for
example, by cross correlation) to each reference projection.  A
“similarity” coefficient (for example, crosscorrelation coefficient)
is generated between each experimental particle and reference
projection. Each individual experimental particle is matched to the
reference projection that gave the highest “similarity”
coefficient. Therefore, it is assumed that this experimental particle
was projected with the same Euler angles as the reference projection.

As an initial map is necessary, we provide initial volume. Click on 
\menu{Imports > Import Volume} and import from

% TODO: explain where. Which dialog? which menu?
% Maybe it's \menu{3D > Preprocess > xmipp3 - preprocess volumes}
% but I don't know.

% TODO: acutally, from this point below (and the last paragraph), it
% is not clear where to click on things, or how the flow is going. I
% think it should be revisited.


\begin{verbatim}
$SCIPION_HOME/data/tests/xmipp_tutorial/micrographs/
\end{verbatim}

\noindent volume \comm{BPV\_scale\_filtered\_windowed\_110.vol} with \textit{sampling rate} 6.185.

To run the projection matching protocol click on
\menu{3D > Refine > xmipp3 -projection matching} and choose expert mode.
Input parameters are displayed in Figures \ref{fig:ProjMatchA}, \ref{fig:ProjMatchB},
\ref{fig:ProjMatchC} and \ref{fig:ProjMatchD} . Here we explain only the ones we need to update
for this reconstruction. For more detail on each parameter please use the respective 
\textbf{help} button.



 \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/09.ProjMatchA}.png}
  \caption{Projection Matching: Input}
  \label{fig:ProjMatchA}
 \end{figure}

 \begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Projection Matching: CTF Correction \& Mask}

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/09.ProjMatchD}.png}
  \caption{Projection Matching: 3D Reconstruction}
  \label{fig:ProjMatchD}
 \end{figure}
 
We need to specify parameters below and execute protocol.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Input particles:} Particles selected previously.
\item \textit{Initial 3D reference volumes:}  Initial volume registered.
\item \textit{Mask reference volumes:} Circular. Masking the reference volume will increase the signal to noise ratio. 
\item \textit{Radius of spherical mask(px):} 55. Since particles size is 110 radius of spherical mask should be 55.
\item \textit{Inner radius for rotational correlation:} 28. Particles will be correlated considering points covered 
by inner and outer radius for rotational correlation.
\item \textit{Outer radius for rotational correlation:} 55. Since particles size is 110 outer radius for rotational correlation should be 55.
\item \textit{Point group symmetry:} i1. Virus type of symmetry.
\item \textit{Constant to be added to the estimated resolution:} -0.05. The volume will be filtered at a frequency equal to
the  resolution computed with resolution\_fsc(FSC=0.5) plus the value provided in this field.

\end{itemize}


Finally, in order to visualize volume reconstructed click on
\keys{Analyze Results} button. Protocol viewer will be displayed (Figure \ref{fig:ProjMatchViewer}).

 \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/11.ProjMatchViewer}.png}
  \caption{Projection matching viewer}
  \label{fig:ProjMatchViewer}
 \end{figure}

In the field 
\textit{Display volume with slices } press the \textbf {eye} button and you will see the 
volume slice by slice (Figure \ref{fig:volShowj}). To visualize the volume with chimera select
chimera (Figure \ref{fig:volChimera}).

 \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/12.VolumeGalleries}.png}
  \caption{Reconstructed volume slices}
  \label{fig:volShowj}
 \end{figure}

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/12.VolumeChimera}.png}
  \caption{Reconstructed volume}
  \label{fig:volChimera}
 \end{figure}

\subsection{Frealign Refinement}

If you want to refine the output volume of projection matching, you can
use \menu{3D > Refine > grigoriefflab - frealign}. First, you need to process the set of particles
that was used as input for projection matching with the features needed
for frealign.


To do this, extract the particles
again, but preprocess particles as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ExtractForFrealign}.

  \begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/06.Extract_ParticlesC}.png}
   \caption{Extract particles for frealign}
   \label{fig:ExtractForFrealign}
 \end{figure}

 
Once the particles are extracted, use \menu{Particles > Set operations > scipion subset}
to create a new set with the particles contained in this set that were used for reconstruction.

Input parameters are displayed in Figures \ref{fig:FrealignA}, \ref{fig:FrealignB}, \ref{fig:FrealignC}
and \ref{fig:FrealignD} . Here we explain only the ones we need to update
for this refinement. 


 \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/19.FrealignA}.png}
  \caption{Frealign: Input}
  \label{fig:FrealignA}
 \end{figure}

 \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/19.FrealignB}.png}
  \caption{Frealign: Flow Control}
  \label{fig:FrealignB}
 \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/19.FrealignC}.png}
  \caption{Frealign: General Parameters}
  \label{fig:FrealignC}
 \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/19.FrealignD}.png}
  \caption{Frealign: 3D Reconstruction}
  \label{fig:FrealignD}
 \end{figure}
 
We need to specify:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Input particles:} Set of particles that was used as input for projection matching 
with the features needed for frealign.
\item \textit{Initial 3D reference volumes:}  Projection matching output volume
\item \textit{Reconstruction radius:} Inner, 10. Outer, 315. Inner and outer radius of the volume to be reconstructed.
\item \textit{Point group symmetry:} I1. Virus symmetry
\item \textit{Resolution of reconstruction:} 15. Resolution to which the reconstruction is calculated.
\item \textit{Resolution in refinement:} Low, 200. High, 20. Resolution of the data included in the search/refinement.
\item \textit{High resolution for classification:} 20. Resolution of the data included in the search/refine. It should typically be set to the same resolution
limit used for the refinement.

\end{itemize}
Then we execute the protocol.


Finally we have obtained the 3D reconstruction of a \emph{Bovine Papillomavirus}.
In order to visualize volume refined click on \keys{Analyze Results}
button or open output volume registered.
Figure \ref{fig:FrealignViewer}.
