\subsection*{Intended audience}

This tutorial provides a general introduction to Scipion, an image
processing framework to obtain 3D models of macromolecular complexes
using Electron Microscopy (EM). It is designed to introduce 3D image
processing in EM to people without any prior knowledge of Scipion,
only limited knowledge about 3D-EM image processing, and with basic
computer skills.

\subsection*{We'd like to hear from you}

We have tested and verified the different steps described in this demo
to the best of our knowledge, but since our programs are in continuous
development you may find inaccuracies and errors in this text. Please,
let us know about any error you find, as well as your suggestions for
future editions by writing to
\href{mailto:scipion@cnb.csic.es}{scipion@cnb.csic.es}.

\section{General Introduction}

\subsection{Download and Install}

The first step before start working on your projects is to download and
install Scipion and all the related programs. At \href{http://scipionwiki.cnb.csic.es}{Scipion's website} 
there is all the information needed to download and install the package.

\section{Reconstruction of a viral capsid}

In this demo, we have used the single particle analysis approach to obtain
a 3D reconstruction of a {\emph Bovine Papillomavirus}. The EM images have been
collected at 300 kV and a calibrated magnification of 56,588, giving a pixel
size  of 1.237 \AA  \citep{Wolf2010}. Data have been kindly
provided by \href{http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/}{Dr. Grigorieff’s Lab}.

\subsection{Getting started}

The data you will work on may be downloaded using the following command:

\verb+scipion testdata --download+

The data will be download in \emph {scipion\_folder/data}. After download, you must
launch the MAIN GUI by typing: \verb+scipion+

Then, create a new project by clicking \textbf{Create project} button, type a 
\textit{project name} and click OK. The GUI main project window will be launched.
The left panel contains different protocols grouped in categories. Clicking on
a group will display a menu with protocols that can be selected to launch the
corresponding GUI.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Import micrographs}

The first step is to import the micrographs to your scipion project. To do this,
press on \textbf{Import Micrographs} button. In \textit{Pattern}  you must indicate
where your micrograph files are stored (clicking on \textbf{browse} button). The 
complete pattern are:
(\emph {\$SCIPION\_HOME/data/tests/xmipp\_tutorial/micrographs/*.mrc}).

Modify the parameters of the Import Micrographs protocol according to the ones
shown in figure~\ref{ImportMics}.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]
{{images/01.Import_Mics}.png}
\caption{Import Micrographs protocol GUI.}
\label{ImportMics}
\end{figure}

When you have completed the form, click on the \textbf{Save \& Execute} button. After
executing the protocol, it will appear in the main Scipion project GUI the new
information shown in figure~\ref{ProjectGUI}

If we press in the \textbf{Analyze results} button it will appear a new pop-up GUI that shows
us the different imported micrographs (not shown)

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{{images/02.Project_GUI}.png}
\caption{Scipion project GUI after processing Import Micrograph protocol.}
\label{ProjectGUI}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Downsampling micrographs}

After importing the micrographs to your Scipion project, you can perform the
next processing step that consists in preprocess micrographs. This protocol
uses several xmipp programs in order to perform several operations over the
micrographs. In this example we use the options shown in figure~\ref{Preprocess}.
Please, put the values as same as figure~\ref{Preprocess}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/03.Downsampling_Mics}.png}
\caption{Preprocess Micrographs GUI.}
\label{Preprocess}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CTF estimation}
The next step is to estimate the CTF of the micrographs. In Scipion you can
estimate the CTF with (at the moment) CTFFind  \citep{Mindell2003} and Xmipp
CTF estimation. You don't have to do anything extra, e.g. change the extension of
the micrographs, to use both programs because in Scipion the inputs and
outputs that belongs to same type of protocols are standarized.

This protocols estimate the PSD (Power Spectrum density) of the micrographs to
estimate the parameters of the CTF (defocus U, defocus V, defocus angle, etc).
They cut the micrographs into a plenty of images with a desire size. After that,
calculate the Fourier transform to each image and averaged.

The CTFs of good micrographs typically have multiple concentric rings, shown
in figure ~\ref{CTFs} left, extending from the image center towards its edges.
Bad micrographs may lack rings or have very few rings that hardly extend from
the image center. A reason to discard micrographs may be the presence of
strongly asymmetric rings (astigmatism, figure ~\ref{CTFs} center) or rings
that fade in a particular direction (drift, figure ~\ref{CTFs} right).

When the protocol is finished you may click on \textbf{Analyze Result} button
(figure \ref{CTFResult}). To discard micrographs with bad CTFs you may click
with the mouse right button and press \textbf{Discard} button. Once you finish
the selection, press on \textbf{Micrographs} button (figure~\ref{CTFResult}).

Sometimes, the CTF estimation algorithm may fail to find the rings even
if they can be seen by eye. If this is the case, you may help the algorithm
to find the rings by clicking with the mouse right button and pressing
\textbf{Recalculate CTF} in the corresponding row of the Output visualization.
A graphical interface will help you to correctly identify the CTF. You must
provide the first CTF zero and the limits and press OK. When you finish, press
\textbf{Recalculate CTFs} button (figure \ref{CTFResult}).

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/images-016.jpg}
\caption{CTF of good, astigmatic and drift micrographs respectively}
\label{CTFs}
\end{figure}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{{images/17.CTFREsults}.png}
\caption{Output visualization of CTFFind protocol that shows the
CTF of all the micrographs and different parameters}
\label{CTFResult}
\end{figure}

\subparagraph{CTFFind}

In order to estimate the CTF with CTFFind, you will need some parameters
describing the frequency region to be analyzed. The parameters shown in
figure~\ref{CTFFind} 7 are the adequate ones for this example.
Note: In a real case, the limit values from frequencies must be adequate so that all zeros of the psd are contained within those frequencies. There is a wizard (figure 7, right) to choose those frequencies. The range of defocus to search is usually larger than the ones used in this example and according to your data set.
