\subsection*{Intended audience}

This tutorial provides a general introduction to Scipion, an image
processing framework to obtain 3D models of macromolecular complexes
using Electron Microscopy (EM). It is designed to introduce 3D image
processing in EM to people without any prior knowledge of Scipion,
only limited knowledge about 3D-EM image processing, and with basic
computer skills.

\subsection*{We'd like to hear from you}

We have tested and verified the different steps described in this demo
to the best of our knowledge, but since our programs are in continuous
development you may find inaccuracies and errors in this text. Please,
